Flowalist
==========

Just playing around to learn JavaScript.

The basic concept is similar to my sideproject @BDGTme, an app for keeping track of your money. You give the app a monthly budget, and for each transaction you add the app subtracts that ammount from your daily, weekly and monthly budgets.

This app will be developed live at <a href="http://flowalist.com">flowalist.com</a>.

** Please note that the app in this first version only will store data in localStorage. **
